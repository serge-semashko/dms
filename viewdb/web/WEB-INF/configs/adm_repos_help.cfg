<h3><p>About ViewDB repository:</h3><p>

<font color=red><b>This ViewDB installation has not ??ONE_REPOS
secondary   ??!repository_2
master      ??!repository
repository defined! All repository tools are disabled.</b></font><p> ??ONE_REPOS

ViewDB uses repository for storing list of instances,
users, user groups and access rights granted for user groups.<p>

There can be 1 or 2 ViewDB repositories (master and secondary).
The secondary repository will be automatically used, when the master 
one is unaviliable. Therefore both repositories must be synchronized.
You can synchronize repositories using "Export" button. 
But <b>make sure, that you are exporting the right one!</b>

<p>
Repository also has database link to <b>found_tcp</b> database for 
finding and quick adding CERN's people to the ViewDB users list.
<p>
Connection information about repositories can be provided for ViewDB as 
a "data-source" item in data-sources.xml or directly in the viewdb.properties file
(see more details in this file)
